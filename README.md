# Low_Light_Denoising
 I tried to implement 3 network in which Zero-DCE performed the worst, the best could have been  MirNET but due to its huge size I was not able to run it thus couldn't get any results for that. <br>
 The one I present is a decoder and encoder.<br>
 Link for the Research paper I implemented- https://stanford.edu/class/ee367/Winter2020/report/parab_report.pdf<br>
 PSNR I got is-15.496921
