# Low_Light_Denoising
 I tried to implement 3 network in which Zero-DCE performed the worst, the best could have been  MirNET but due to its huge size I was not able to run it thus couldn't get any results for that. 
 The one I present is a decoder and encoder which gave a PSNR of 15.5 approximately.
